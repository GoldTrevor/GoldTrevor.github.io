          <p class="yes">Why do we need to be using electric cars?</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p class="tsla.jpg">
          <p> We need to be using electric vehicles to decrease the amount of carbon emissions we release into the atmosphere.  Currently, gas powered cars account for 28% of carbon released into the atmosphere.  By going electric, we move to a brighter future and have a better chance at taking further steps to reverse climate change.
            Though some may argue that electric cars still have a carbon foot print, with the increase use of electric cars, companies and cities with the right funding can have charging stations that get energy not from the grid, but from renewable recources.  This includes mainly wind farms and solar fields.  Companies such as Tesla have already began to power supercharging stations with solar panels.  With more support and customers, these companies can do the same for all charging stations.
              Additionally, with more funding, companies can increase efficiency and saftey of lithium mining which is also a concern when thinking about purchasing an electric car.  Another advantage to electric cars are their performance.  EVs can accelerate faster than most gas powered vehicles.  This is because they do not require a transmission as they are able to provide 100% torque 100% of the time.  Also, it is cheaper to charge an electric car than it is tofill up a car with gas. </p>
          <p> We can already see an increase in sales for EVs.  After companies such as Tesla made Electric Vehicles cool and stylish, many more people wished to purchase them.  after Tesla sales went through the roof, other big car companies like Porche, Audi, and BMW started producing EVs and concepts that became competition for Tesla.  With more competition came a better market and industry.  More competition also leads to better products with more technological advancements.  Even during the pandemic, Tesla sales were still relativley booming in places such as China.   Additionally, when car companies release more affordable and desireable EVs, sales will increase even more since they will be available to people with less money. </p>
          <p> All in all, electric cars and vehicles are the future whether we like it or not.  We are eventually going to run out of fossil fuels to fill up our 4mpg cars and will need a cleaner and better alternative. </p>
